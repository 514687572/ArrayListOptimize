\subsection{Performance Analysis in Distributed Environment}

Our experimental results demonstrate significant performance improvements in several key areas of distributed computing:

\subsubsection{Distributed Insertion Performance}
The BufferedArrayList shows remarkable improvement in middle insertion operations across distributed nodes, achieving up to 4.4x better performance compared to standard ArrayList. This improvement is primarily attributed to:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Reduced element movement across network
    \item Efficient distributed buffer utilization
    \item Optimized chunk management in distributed environment
    \item Minimized network communication overhead
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Distributed Deletion Performance}
Similar improvements are observed in deletion operations across distributed nodes, with up to 5.9x better performance. The key factors contributing to this improvement are:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Minimized data shifting across network
    \item Efficient distributed chunk consolidation
    \item Smart buffer reuse across nodes
    \item Optimized network communication patterns
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Distributed Memory Efficiency}

Our implementation maintains reasonable memory overhead while providing performance benefits in distributed environments:
\begin{itemize}
    \item With CHUNK\_SIZE = 64: overhead $\approx$ 1.56n across nodes
    \item With CHUNK\_SIZE = 128: overhead $\approx$ 1.28n across nodes
    \item Network-aware memory allocation
    \item Efficient distributed memory management
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Limitations and Trade-offs in Distributed Systems}

Several limitations and trade-offs should be considered in distributed environments:

\subsubsection{Distributed Memory Overhead}
The chunked structure introduces additional memory overhead in distributed systems:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Distributed chunk metadata storage
    \item Network-aware buffer allocation
    \item Potential memory fragmentation across nodes
    \item Network communication overhead
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Distributed Access Patterns}
The performance benefits vary depending on distributed access patterns:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Sequential access may be slower across network
    \item Random access requires additional network communication
    \item Cache utilization may be less optimal in distributed environment
    \item Network latency impact on performance
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Applicability in Distributed Systems}

Our solution is particularly suitable for:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Distributed text editors and document processors
    \item Distributed data manipulation tools
    \item High-performance computing applications
    \item Distributed database systems
    \item Cloud computing environments
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Future Improvements}

Several areas for future improvement have been identified:

\subsubsection{Distributed Concurrency Support}
Adding distributed thread safety while maintaining performance:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Distributed lock-free algorithms
    \item Network-aware atomic operations
    \item Distributed concurrent modification detection
    \item Network partition handling
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Distributed Memory Optimization}
Further reducing memory overhead in distributed systems:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Network-aware adaptive chunk sizing

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Comparison with Existing Distributed Solutions}

Our approach offers several advantages over existing distributed solutions:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Better performance for distributed middle operations
    \item More predictable memory usage across nodes
    \item Simpler distributed implementation
    \item Efficient network communication
\end{itemize}

However, it also has some disadvantages:
\begin{itemize}
