\section{Conclusion}
Our BufferedArrayList implementation demonstrates significant performance improvements for middle insertions and deletions while maintaining reasonable performance for other operations. The key findings include:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Up to 4.4x faster random insertions
    \item Up to 5.9x faster random deletions
    \item Comparable performance for append operations
    \item Slightly slower random access (acceptable trade-off)
    \item Memory overhead bounded by O(n + n/CHUNK\_SIZE)
\end{itemize}

The chunked buffer strategy provides an effective solution for applications requiring frequent modifications to the middle of large arrays, particularly in scenarios such as:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Text editors
    \item Dynamic document processing
    \item Real-time data manipulation
\end{itemize}

\section{Future Work}
Several promising directions for future research include:

\subsection{Adaptive Chunk Sizing}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Dynamic adjustment of chunk size based on access patterns
    \item Machine learning-based optimization of chunk parameters
    \item Workload-aware chunk management
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Parallel Processing Support}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Concurrent chunk modifications
    \item Lock-free chunk operations
    \item Distributed chunk management
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Memory Optimization}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Compressed chunk storage
    \item Predictive chunk allocation
    \item Garbage collection optimization
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Application-Specific Optimizations}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Specialized chunk layouts for specific data types
    \item Cache-aware chunk organization
    \item NUMA-aware chunk placement
\end{itemize}
